What I Learned

This project helped me build both technical and problem-solving skills.

Learned how to use the Arduino IDE to write, verify, and upload code to an Adafruit development board.

Gained hands-on experience connecting hardware to a computer and resolving driver/port issues.

Practiced debugging and troubleshooting code using ChatGPT as a learning and support tool.

Learned how to interpret compiler errors and adjust logic step-by-step.

Improved my understanding of how embedded software communicates with hardware.

Project Reflection

This project showed me how real-world development requires patience, testing, and iteration.
Using ChatGPT helped me break down errors, understand how the code and hardware interact, and find solutions faster. It also taught me how to research, ask better technical questions, and validate fixes before moving forward.
